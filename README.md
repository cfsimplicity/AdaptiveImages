# Adaptive Images
This is a CFML version of Matt Wilcox's [Adaptive Images](http://adaptive-images.com/), a server-side solution to automatically create, cache, and deliver device-appropriate versions of your websiteâ€™s images.

If your site's design is "responsive", so that images are not given a fixed width or height but scaled to the width of their container, you can save bandwidth and speed up client load times by using AdaptiveImages to ensure end users do not have to download images intended for the widest screens. Instead, smaller versions will be created and served as necessary, according to the detected resolution of the device.

## Acknowledgements
In addition to [Matt's PHP code](https://github.com/MattWilcox/Adaptive-Images), I also took inspiration and code from [Raymond Camden's ColdFusion fork](https://github.com/cfjedimaster/Adaptive-Images)

### Differences
However, this is not a direct port of either project. It places more emphasis on performance through:

 - in-memory caching of file path and existence tests to minimise disk access;
 - assuming the source file existence check has been handled by the web server rewrite engine;
 - checking that the bytesize of the resized file is no larger than the original (sometimes downscaling an image can actually increase its file size);

There are additional file and memory cache maintenance functions to ensure they don't become stale.

## Requirements
 - Lucee Server 4.5 or later
 - Adobe ColdFusion 11 or later
 - Web server URL rewriting

## Usage

1) Create an instance of AdaptiveImages in the onApplicationStart() method of your Application.cfc, specifying the resolutions you want to support (use your web analytics to determine the most common device widths).

```
application.adaptiveImages = New adaptiveImages( resolutions: [ 320, 480, 768, 1024, 1400, 1680 ] );
```

2) Create a ColdFusion template in your webroot to invoke the AdaptiveImages component and pass image requests to it.

***adaptiveImages.cfm***
```
<cfscript>
try{
 application.adaptiveImages.process( cgi.HTTP_X_ORIGINAL_URL );
}
catch( any exception ){
 abort;
}
</cfscript>
```

(Note: `cgi.HTTP_X_ORIGINAL_URL` is the variable made available in ColdFusion by IIS7+. If using a different web server, it will have its own cgi scoped key name for the originally requested URL).

3) Add a rule to your web server's Rewrite Engine to intercept requests for image files and pass them to the CF template. Your rule should define which images you want AdaptiveImages to handle. Here's an example in **IIS7+** format:

```
<rule name="Adaptive Images" stopProcessing="true">
  <!-- Source image matching rule: this one applies AI to files in the /images/ folder only, no sub-folders -->
  <match url="images/[^\/]+\.(?:jpe?g|gif|png)$" />
  <action type="Rewrite" url="adaptiveImages.cfm" appendQueryString="false" />
  <!-- Test existence of source file here. Faster than using CF -->
  <conditions>
  	<add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" />
  </conditions>
</rule>
```

4) Add the following javascript to the HTML `<head>` of all of your web pages to detect and store the client device's resolution/pixel density.
```
<script>
document.cookie='resolution='+Math.max(screen.width,screen.height)+'-'+("devicePixelRatio" in window? devicePixelRatio: 1)+'; path=/';
</script>
```
If you are using HTTPS then you should add the `secure` attribute:
```
<script>
document.cookie='resolution='+Math.max(screen.width,screen.height)+'-'+("devicePixelRatio" in window? devicePixelRatio: 1)+'; path=/; secure';
</script>
```
Note: unlike the orginal Adaptive Images implementation, the screen width and pixel ration values are separated by a **hyphen** not a comma, since it appears that cookie values set by javascript and containing commas are not always read by the server. 

## Configuration options
You can pass these arguments when instantiating AdaptiveImages.cfc:
 - `resolutions` *required*. An array of the device widths you wish to support, in pixels and in any order.
 - `cacheFileOperations` boolean: default=true. Whether to cache source file paths and file existence tests to avoid unnecessary disk access. You will normally want to keep this enabled unless your source files change very frequently and you are not using the cache maintenance functions, or you are memory-constrained and have a lot of files (but note that only the *paths* are stored, not the images themselves).
 - `checkForFileUpdates` boolean: default=false. Ensure updated source images are re-cached (requires disk access on every request).
 - `cacheFolderName` string: default="". Store the resized images in a sub-folder with this name
 - `browserCacheSeconds` integer: default=2592000 (30 days). Number of seconds the *browser* cache should last.
 - `pixelDensityMultiplier` number between 1 and 3: default=1.5. By how much to multiply the resolution for "retina" displays as detected by the resolution cookie.
 - `jpgQuality` number between 1 and 100: default=50. The quality of resized JPGs.
 - `sharpen` boolean: default=true. Shrinking images can blur details. Perform a sharpen on re-scaled images?
 - `interpolation` string: default="highPerformance". Interpolation algorithm to use when scaling/resizing file (depending on whether performance or quality is paramount).
 - `writeLogs` boolean: default=false. Whether or not to log activity - don't use in production.
 - `logFilename`: string: default="adaptive-images". If logging, the name of the file.
 - `logErrors`: boolean: default=[writeLogs value]. If `writeLogs` is false, allow just errors in processing to be logged.

## Updating source files
For best performance keep the `checkForFileUpdates` option disabled. If you need to update or delete a source image, call the `deleteCachedCopies( fullImagePath )` method from your update/delete code passing in the full path of the image file.

## Housekeeping
Use the `cleanupCacheFolders( sourceImageFolder )` method periodically to remove any cached files where the source image no longer exists. Currently this function is not recursive, so needs to be applied separately to each parent source image folder containing cached image folders.

## Test Suite
Tests require [TestBox 2.1](https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/TestBox) or later. You will need to create an application mapping for `/testbox`.
